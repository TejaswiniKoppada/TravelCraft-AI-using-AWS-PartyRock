## 🛠️ AWS Services Behind PartyRock
While PartyRock provides a **no-code front-end**, it is built on top of **Amazon Bedrock** and other AWS services:  

- **Amazon Bedrock** → Provides API access to multiple **foundation models (FMs)** without requiring infrastructure setup.  
- **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** → Manages user permissions and secure access to PartyRock.  
- **Amazon S3 (optional, internal use)** → Can be used for storing generated artifacts (e.g., prompts, app metadata).  
- **AWS Amplify (optional)** → Under the hood, AWS may use Amplify-like hosting for published apps.

## 🤖 Foundation Models Available via Bedrock (Used in PartyRock)
PartyRock relies on **Amazon Bedrock** to deliver Generative AI features. The following models are accessible:  

1. **Anthropic Claude** (Claude 1, 2, 3 family)  
   - Great for **conversational AI, text generation, summarization**.  
   - Used when PartyRock apps need **structured outputs** (like schedules, tables, or lists).  

2. **Amazon Titan**  
   - Titan Text → For text generation and embedding.  
   - Titan Image → For **image generation** and editing (if you add image widgets).  

3. **AI21 Labs (Jurassic models)**  
   - Optimized for **long-form text, creative writing, and reasoning tasks**.  

4. **Meta LLaMA 2** (via Bedrock)  
   - Efficient open-source model for **general-purpose text generation**.  

5. **Stability AI (Stable Diffusion)** *(may be available via Bedrock in some regions)*  
   - For advanced **image generation** tasks.
