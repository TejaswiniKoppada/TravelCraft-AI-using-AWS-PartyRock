TravelCraft AI is a **Generative AI-powered travel itinerary planner** built using **Amazon PartyRock**.  
It allows users to enter a **destination, trip duration, and preferences** to instantly generate a **personalized day-by-day travel plan** with suggested activities, sightseeing spots, and local food recommendations.

This project was created as part of AWS Generative AI learning, showcasing how **no-code AI platforms** like PartyRock can help quickly build and share functional applications.
